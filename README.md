# Project Name

This 2D Platformer is created using Godot. It is a project that was made for SP23-BL-MSCH-C220

You play an man for hire trying to find coins for a drink at the local tavern. He must traverse the land of a few cyclopse golems before he can get that drink though. 

## Implementation
Attack function, original animated sprite for player, original animated sprite for enemy, looped music, special flip jump animation for player, extra coins, more than 1 enemy.

## References
Unlicenced music, "Not Giving Up", original character and enemy sprites

## Future Development
I want to make this a complete game in the future. Perhapse once I can memorize functions and have fewer debugging.
